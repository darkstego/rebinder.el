;;; Commentary:

;; This package allows users to easily rebind prefix keys like C-c and C-x
;; to other keys.  These new prefixes dynamically generate the target keymap by
;; propogating all active keymaps.  The package also takes care of overriding
;; the behavior of those prefix keys so they can be used for any other function.
;; This override is done by placing mappings to these keys in the minor-mode-overrding maps.
